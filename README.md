# Task Board Starter Code

## Goals & Acceptance Criteria (adapted from the CWRU prompt)
1. When I open the task board I see a list of projects sorted into
    - Not Started, In Progress, Completed
2. When I view the task board I see each task is color-coded
    - Yellow = deadline approaching; Red = deadline passed
3. When I click the button to define a new task I can enter into a **modal**
    - Title; Description; Deadline Date (via dayjs)
4. When I click save, the new task is saved to local storage
5. When I drag tasks to different progress columns, the progress updates and remains upon refresh
6. When tasks are deleted, this also persists with a page refresh
7. When I exit the page and return, my task board is displayed up-to-date/how I left it
